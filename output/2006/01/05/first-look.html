        <div id="content">
          <p><a href="/images/pages.gif"><img src="/images/pages_t.gif" class="float-right" alt="" /></a> I&#8217;ve decided to follow <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/the_interface_as_a_spec_including_stories_inline.php">37signals&#8217; advice</a> and draw out &#8220;screens&#8221; for the admin system of the Ruby site before I do any major coding.</p>
          <p>I spent the afternoon drawing a few screens out on paper. This evening I took one of the screens and fleshed it out in Fireworks. Pictured left is the final result. It&#8217;s a comp of the first page you will see after you login. It reveals the main contours of the way I picture the <span class="caps">CMS</span> working.</p>
          <p>The first three tabs across the top are for the three main model objects: Pages, Templates, and Snippets.</p>
          <p><strong>Pages</strong> are the meat of the system. Each page will store the Textile formated data for a physical page on the Web site. Pages will be able to contain other pages using a simple template language. It will be easy to use the template language to create a blog index which lists the most recent articles.</p>
          <p>Each page will also be able to specify a <strong>Template</strong> with which it should be rendered. This should make it easy to repeat a look across several pages.</p>
          <p>Pages will also have the ability to include the content from <strong>Snippets</strong>&#8212;little bits of content that will be repeated accross several pages.</p>
          <p>I also spent some time today thinking about a name for my new <span class="caps">CMS</span>. I&#8217;d like to use a term from the gemstone world. Scanning through the terms in a <a href="http://www.zulumoon.com/glossary/R-glossary.htm">jewelry glossary</a> I ran accross a couple of words that would make really good names.</p>
          <p>The first one that I liked was &#8220;brilliant&#8221;. Brilliant cut is the superman shaped gemstone. Brillaint <span class="caps">CMS</span> has a nice ring to it, but it does sound a little vain.</p>
          <p>The other option that I liked was &#8220;radiant&#8221;. Radiant cut is a squarish shape. I don&#8217;t like the shape as much a brilliant cut, but the name is rather nice. Unless someone has other suggestions I think I am going to call it Radiant <span class="caps">CMS</span>.</p>
