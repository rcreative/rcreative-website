title: Introducing Radius
---

I'm pleased to announce the first release of Radius--a small, but powerful template language for Ruby similar to the ones used in "MovableType":http://www.movabletype.org and "TextPattern":http://www.textpattern.com. It uses tags similar to HTML, but can be used to generate any form of plain text (XML, e-mail, etc...).

Check out the documentation at:

"http://radius.rubyforge.org":http://radius.rubyforge.org

Or get started with the gem right away:

<notextile>
{% highlight bash %}
$ gem install radius
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

Radius was conceived and coded by the 3 founding members of the Chicago Area Ruby Group (myself, Brian Young, and Ryan Platte).

*Update:* Radius has moved to Github: "http://github.com/jlong/radius":http://github.com/jlong/radius.
