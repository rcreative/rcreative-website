title: "Poor Manâ€™s Site Stats"
---

One of the strange things about the normal TextDrive plan is that they don't provide any site statistics. Fooling around on the command line recently I came up with this:

<notextile>
{% highlight bash %}
$ cat logs/access_log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq | wc -l
     538
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

Which tells me the number of unique IP addresses that have hit my site in the last day. Without getting too complicated I can also get the total number of unique visitors ever (or at least as far back as my logs go).

Here's the code:

<notextile>
{% highlight bash %}
$ (cat logs/access_log && gzip -dc logs/access_log*.gz) | awk '{ print $1 }' | sort | uniq | wc -l
    3887
{% endhighlight %}
</notextile>

And this shows me the total number of unique visitors to "RadiantCMS.org":http://radiantcms.org/.
