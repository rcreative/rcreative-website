title: Radiant CMS Behaviors
---

!(float-left)/images/radiant-multi-lingual.gif! One of the features I'm really excited about in the CMS I'm building for "ruby-lang.org":http://ruby-lang.org is support for what I am calling "behaviors". A behavior is a Ruby mixin of sorts that alters the way a page behaves on the site. It can do everything from changing the way content is rendered to setting headers on the response. Think of a behavior as a special plugin for pages.

This morning I finished coding a behavior for the Ruby site that will redirect you to a sub-folder of the site based on your prefered language (a browser configurable setting).

Above you can see that I've already started testing it. The CMS seems to be handling Japanese rather well.
